Context  
Create a database file locally with round trip prices for different cities. Define a tool to get a price for a city bassed on this database file. AutoGen uses a model, an agent with system messages and the tool to provide an answer based on a user message related to a price for a city. 

The user message in this example is *I'd like to go to London*.  
The screenshot below shows an answer provided by AutoGen.
