# AI_learning_AutoGen  

## lab 1  

Context  
Create a database file locally with round trip prices for different cities. Define a tool to get a price for a city bassed on this database file. AutoGen uses a model, an agent with system messages and the tool to provide an answer based on a user message related to a price for a city. 

The user message in this example is *I'd like to go to London*.  
The screenshot below shows an answer provided by AutoGen.

## lab 2    

Context  
There are four topics in this lab using AutoGen. 

The first one is to use autogen to read an image from a provided link and then to use MultiModalMessage to create a user message so that a response could be provided for a defined agent. The user message in this example is *Describe the content of this image in detail*.  

The screenshot below shows the response.
